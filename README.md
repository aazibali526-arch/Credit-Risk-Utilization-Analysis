# Credit Utilization & Early Risk Detection Analysis for a Banking Institution

## Overview

This project analyzes customer credit behavior to identify early warning signals of financial stress using credit utilization patterns. The objective is to generate risk intelligence that supports proactive credit risk management within a banking environment.

## Problem Statement

Credit risk is one of the most critical risk categories faced by banking institutions. Banks generate revenue by extending credit facilities such as credit cards and credit lines. However, when borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations, institutions experience financial losses, increased capital provisioning requirements, and regulatory pressure.

One of the most significant behavioral indicators of potential financial stress is **credit utilization**.

**Credit Utilization Ratio = Outstanding Balance / Total Credit Limit**

This ratio measures the proportion of available credit that a customer is currently using. Elevated or rapidly increasing utilization levels may signal:

- Liquidity constraints  
- Over-dependence on revolving credit  
- Reduced repayment capacity  
- Higher probability of future delinquency  

Beyond static values, behavioral trends in utilization often serve as early warning signals. These may include sudden usage spikes, persistent near-limit borrowing, or irregular repayment behavior. Identifying such patterns at an early stage enables banks to intervene proactively before accounts transition into serious delinquency or default.

This project focuses on uncovering utilization-based risk patterns and translating them into actionable business insights.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is:

**To detect early warning risk signals using customer credit behavior patterns and utilization trends in order to support proactive credit risk management.**

Specifically, this project aims to:

- Analyze distribution and trends of credit utilization  
- Identify high-utilization and high-risk customer segments  
- Detect abnormal behavioral patterns indicating financial stress  
- Generate visual insights for risk monitoring  
- Provide actionable recommendations for portfolio risk management  

The final outcome of this project is to transform raw credit data into meaningful risk intelligence that can support decision-making within a banking risk management framework.
